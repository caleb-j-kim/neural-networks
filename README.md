Neural Network Model on the Wine Quality Dataset

Overview: This project implements a neural network model and optimizes it on the Wine Quality dataset.

Setup: Ensure Python 3.x is installed. Install the required libraries in the terminal in the working directory:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras

Run the code using the command: python NeuralNetAssignment.py

The dataset is hosted on GitHub and is automatically loaded by the script.
